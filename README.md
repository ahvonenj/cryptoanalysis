# Cryptoanalysis

Decrypting stuff is hard. This repo aims to provide tool(s) to make it easier. Check [wiki](https://github.com/ahvonenj/cryptoanalysis/wiki) for more information and [resources](https://github.com/ahvonenj/cryptoanalysis/wiki/Resources).

## Main features

- Encrypt data
- Decrypt / analyze crypted data
- Hash (format) example list(s)


## Encrypting

- One-click encrypt with multiple algorithms


## Decrypting / data-analysis

- Compare hashes
- Guess hashing method used
- Show other possible insights about the hash(es)
- Try to decrypt the hash or parts of it


### Comparing hashes

- Compare multiple hashes with each other
- Find similarities between hashes


### Guessing hashing method used

- Check if the hash-string has an identification block
- Compare hash(es) to existing ones
- Look for patterns and similarities


### Other insights about the hash(es)

- Hash length
- Hash bits
- (entropy)


### Try to decrypt the hash or parts of it

- As a UNIX timestamp
- As an IP-address
- As an MAC-address
- As a datetime


## Hash (format) example list(s)

- Hash examples
- Hash format examples
